# Formal Logic

We speak truths others understand in sentences. "I am writing now" is true as I write this but not as you read this. I might better state, "Scott McLoughlis is writing this December 2017." Then we are both less confused.

Formal logic is the basis for computer logic. Since computers are not humans, computers can only manipulate syntax. They cannot guess or intuit our meanings of computer code we write.

Thus we give formal logic a SEMANTICS or meaning. In some regard SEMANTICS is primary. Humans write syntax. We make haphazard clerical mistakes or seeming accuracte but not logic mistakes all the time. Only SEMANTICS lets us know them as wrong and correct them. 

# Logical Operators

Primary logical operators are AND-ALSO, OR-BOTH, OR-ELSE, ONLY-IF.

These are dyadic operators taking two PREPOSITIONS which we represent as variables.

We assign symbols to the operators.

          & - AND-ALSO
          | - AND-OR
          ^ - OR-ELSE
          -> - IF-THEN


Let us use HUMANS for propositions.

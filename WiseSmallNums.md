# The Wisdom Of Small Numbers

## Introduction

My Claim Is Simply That Small Numbers Form Easily Understood And Applied Geometries And Formulae Of Arithmetic or Logical Operators The Overdetermine Moral Reasoning In Most Daily Interesting Situations. 

I Claim That This Wisdom Should Be Universally Taught To All Humans Upon Adulthood.

Remaining Ethical Claims Determining Indifferent Adjacency, Appartness, Physical Cooperation Or Physical Conflict Between People Known And Unknown To Each Other Will Become Mostly Clear.

I Claim That Preponderance Of Consensus Renders Dull Nuances Of Those Tribal Or Functional Distinctions.
